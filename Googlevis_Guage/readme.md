## Introduction 

This Shiny Application is created for googleVis Guage in shiny application 

## Requirenments 

> install.packages("shiny")

> install.packages("googleVis")

Shiny and googleVis packages for this application 

## Code Details 
To get started, open its app.R file. Edit the script to match the one below:
```python
library(shiny)

# Define UI ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
)

# Define server logic ----
server <- function(input, output) {
  
}

# Run the app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
This code is the bare minimum needed to create a Shiny app. The result is an empty app with a blank user interface, an appropriate starting point for this lesson.

## UI Layout
Shiny uses the function fluidPage to create a display that automatically adjusts to the dimensions of your userâ€™s browser window. You lay out the user interface of your app by placing elements in the fluidPage function.

For example, the ui function below creates a user interface that has a title panel and a sidebar layout, which includes a sidebar panel and a main panel. Note that these elements are placed within the fluidPage function.


titlePanel and sidebarLayout are the two most popular elements to add to fluidPage. They create a basic Shiny app with a sidebar.

sidebarLayout always takes two arguments:

- sidebarPanel function output

- mainPanel function output

```python
numericInput('n1', 'Enter your Base Accuracy', 40, 0.5, 100),
 column(4,htmlOutput("view1")),
```
The item use here is NumericInput which has :
- ID as `n1`
- Text `Enter your Base Accuracy` as text
- Range `40, 0.5, 100` (Value,Minimum,Maximun)

And HTML Output name view1


## Server code

```python
output$view1 <- renderGvis({
    df1 <- data.frame(Label = "Base Accuracy", Value = input$n1)
    gvisGauge(df1,
              options=list(min=0, max=150, greenFrom=120,
                           greenTo=150, yellowFrom=75, yellowTo=119.9,
                           redFrom=0, redTo=74.99, width=300, height=300));  
    
  })
```

Here output for view1 is of type renderGvis

`df1` is the dataframe with value as input from `numberinput`
