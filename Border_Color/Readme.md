## Introduction 

This Shiny Application is used to created border color for any Output Text box in shiny application or any item of the R shiny 

## Requirenments 

> install.packages("shiny")

> install.packages("shinyjs")

Shiny and Shinyjs packages for this application 

## Code Details 
To get started, open its app.R file. Edit the script to match the one below:
```python
library(shiny)

# Define UI ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
)

# Define server logic ----
server <- function(input, output) {
  
}

# Run the app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
This code is the bare minimum needed to create a Shiny app. The result is an empty app with a blank user interface, an appropriate starting point for this lesson.

## UI Layout
Shiny uses the function fluidPage to create a display that automatically adjusts to the dimensions of your userâ€™s browser window. You lay out the user interface of your app by placing elements in the fluidPage function.

For example, the ui function below creates a user interface that has a title panel and a sidebar layout, which includes a sidebar panel and a main panel. Note that these elements are placed within the fluidPage function.


titlePanel and sidebarLayout are the two most popular elements to add to fluidPage. They create a basic Shiny app with a sidebar.

sidebarLayout always takes two arguments:

- sidebarPanel function output

- mainPanel function output

```python
selectInput("TagColor", "Color of my Tag",choices=c("Red","Blue","Yellow","Black", "grey","orange","pink","purple"), 
                selected = "Red", multiple = FALSE)),
  ```
Here 
- Id is `TagColor` 
- Choices is the list of options to be displayed for the User for selection, 
- `Selecte="Red"` Means by Default it is Red
- `multiple = FALSE` Which means disabling multiple selection options.


```python
div(style="width:300px;padding-left:10px;",fluidRow(verbatimTextOutput("Pop",placeholder = TRUE)))
```
Here 
- `Div` Is division tage same as HTML
- `Style="width:300px;padding-left:10px;"` Here you are asigning style for that specific Division 
- `fluidRow()`  Rows exist for the purpose of making sure their elements appear on the same line (if the browser has adequate width)
- `verbatimTextOutput("Pop",placeholder = TRUE)`
  * Arguments:
  *  `outputId`	output variable to read the value from i.e **Pop**
  * `placeholder`	if the output is empty or NULL, should an empty rectangle be displayed to serve as a placeholder? (does not affect behavior when the the output in nonempty) 


## Server Code 
``` python
observe( **Code for the operations to be done**)
```
Create a reactive observer i.e as soon as any event or operation happens to that shiny page

``` Python
d <- input$TagColor
```

Storing the input value i.e `selectInput` value into a variable. i.e TagColor

``` python
color <- paste0("solid ", tolower(color))
``` 
Converting to lower case

```python
 runjs(paste0("document.getElementById('Pop').style.border ='",color,"'"))
 ````
 To run javascript code 
 
 ```python
 
 output$Pop <-renderText({d})
 ```
 
 This is used to render the value to that perticular output id
