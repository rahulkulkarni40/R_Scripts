## Introduction 

This Shiny Application is used to created border color for any Output Text box in shiny application or any item of the R shiny 

## Requirenments 

> install.packages("shiny")

> install.packages("shinyjs")

Shiny and Shinyjs packages for this application 

## Code Details 
To get started, open its app.R file. Edit the script to match the one below:
```python
library(shiny)

# Define UI ----
ui <- fluidPage(
  
)

# Define server logic ----
server <- function(input, output) {
  
}

# Run the app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
This code is the bare minimum needed to create a Shiny app. The result is an empty app with a blank user interface, an appropriate starting point for this lesson.

## UI Layout
Shiny uses the function fluidPage to create a display that automatically adjusts to the dimensions of your userâ€™s browser window. You lay out the user interface of your app by placing elements in the fluidPage function.

For example, the ui function below creates a user interface that has a title panel and a sidebar layout, which includes a sidebar panel and a main panel. Note that these elements are placed within the fluidPage function.


titlePanel and sidebarLayout are the two most popular elements to add to fluidPage. They create a basic Shiny app with a sidebar.

sidebarLayout always takes two arguments:

- sidebarPanel function output

- mainPanel function output
